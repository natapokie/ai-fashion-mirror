## Getting started
First, we'll need to install frontend and backend dependencies.

```shell
cd client
npm i
cd ../server
npm i
```

## Running the Code
Currently, you'll have the run with frontend and backend in two different terminals

```shell
# in one terminal start the client
cd client
npm run dev
```

```shell
# in another terminal start the server
cd server
npm run dev
```
