# Prototype 1: AI Fashion Mirror

The DIY Smart Mirror prototype involves using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and a monitor to create an interactive mirror. The mirror displays real-time information and interacts with the user based on image processing and AI feedback.

## Initial Prompt and Motivation

## Smart Mirror Implementation and Build

The AI Fashion Mirror combines several key technologies and components to function effectively:

1. Hardware Components:
    - Raspberry Pi: Serves as the central processing unit, running the software that controls the smart mirror.

    - Camera: Captures the user's image, allowing the system to analyze the outfit in real-time.

    - Monitor: Reflective surface where the user sees their own image overlaid with fashion feedback and outfit recommendations.

2. Software and AI Integration:
    - Next.js: Powers the frontend application running on the Raspberry Pi, which displays the mirror interface.
    
    - PRE API: This API is utilized to generate constructive feedback on the user's outfit. The feedback is modeled after social media engagement, where the user receives comments and likes, mimicking the feel of interacting with others online.

3. User Interaction:
    - A "social media" style interface allows users to see how many likes, and comments they receive for their outfit choices.
