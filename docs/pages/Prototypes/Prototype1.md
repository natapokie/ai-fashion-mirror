# Prototype 1: DIY Smart Mirror

The DIY Smart Mirror prototype involves using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and a monitor to create an interactive mirror. The mirror displays real-time information and interacts with the user based on image processing and AI feedback.

## Repo Organization

- **client/**: Contains the frontend code for displaying the smart mirror interface.
- **server/**: Contains the backend API that handles image processing and AI tasks.
- **scripts/**: Helper scripts for setting up and managing the mirror hardware and software.
- **docs/**: This documentation site.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React for creating a dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express for handling API requests and managing communication with the frontend.
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI's models for processing images and generating feedback.
- **Camera Service**: Captures the user's image for processing and display.
- **Database**: No database required for this prototype.

## Required Keys

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for calling OpenAI models for image processing and feedback.
- **Camera Configuration**: Ensure the camera is properly set up and accessible by the Raspberry Pi.
