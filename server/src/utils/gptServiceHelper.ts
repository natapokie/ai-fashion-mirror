Pretend you’re a fashion expert working for Canada Goose. 
I want a JSON array with three recommended Canada Goose products. 
Consider that the user is likely in Toronto, where the weather can get very cold, and they may be spending time outdoors in an urban setting. 
Recommend Canada Goose products that would fit well with this environment, while also aligning with the user’s style in the photo provided (cozy winter outfit with a beanie and winter boots).

Each recommendation should include:
    •    A productName (the name of the Canada Goose product),
    •    A valid image URL from Canada Goose’s official website (make sure it links directly to the product page),
    •    A feedback section with casual, fun feedback in HTML, using the <b> tag to bold key words in the feedback.

Here’s an example of the format I need:
{
"productName": """insert Canada Goose product name here""",
"image": """insert the image url here""",,
"feedback": """insert feedback here""",,
}
